# Network Security - Privacy Issues in IOT
This is a research project which discusses Privacy Issues in IOT and proposed solution to it. In this project, we proposed a suitable wireless security mechanism for the hospital.

**Problem Statement**

Internet of Things (IoT) is a combination of technologies that capable of interacting and communicating
using networking technologies such as RFID, NFC and sensor nodes. IoT is a global network
infrastructure which links physical and virtual objects by merging data collection and communication
capabilities. There are many applications for IoT and one of its examples is healthcare systems.
Healthcare systems use a set of interconnected devices to create an IoT network which devoted to
healthcare monitoring system. One of the main challenges is to apply RFID system in ubiquitous
healthcare system with embedded sensor modules based on IoT. Due to limited resources of sensor
nodes, certain strategies and mechanisms are required to ensure adequate Advanced Science and
Technology Letters.


To deal with several security challenges as well as growth in diverse community in an interconnected
network, we need a security framework to manage diverse processing requirements and control
capabilities. The purpose of the framework design is to meet the needs of new e-health security
challenges. To ensure a global system, end-to-end perspective system can uncover unintended threats
that may not be available at the individual’ element level, we need to have a national level protection
standard to meet the emerging e-healthcare needs. There is a great risk of a number of threats
especially for wireless networks which can be more vulnerable due to its invisible feature. In recent
years, hospitals also employ wireless Advanced Science and Technology SERSC communication systems
as other enterprises, and the hospitals maintain many personal details for the medical purpose such as
patient’s medical history. However, only a few hospitals are aware of the security issues because their
working process is mainly focused on emergency than security matters. This may result in a security
incident such as information leakage.

**Proposed Solution**

In order to apply RFID system in healthcare system, enhanced secure mobile health system should be developed using wireless communication to solve security problem. This system includes two-way
interactive authentication process, sensor technology, and health informatics. Especially, sensor
technologies for identification play an important role in intelligent services using network
communications. The personnel private data would be collected through wireless monitoring devices.
As a first step of security, well-organized authentication processes based on network should be
prepared against various threats for wireless networks.The security framework focuses on mechanisms
for the distribution and establishment of secret keys that allow bootstrapping secure links, access
control to the sensed information, and privacy-aware management of the medical data and user's
identities. Centralized and distributed security solutions are combined in order to provide enough balance between performance and security requirements. Network security and management play animportant role in each level. Then we should analyze the security features in each layer such as perceptual layer, network layer, support layer and application layer. Now, we should take into account
to look into the state of research for the security requirements such as encryption mechanism,
communication security, protecting sensor data, and cryptographic algorithms in communication
channel.

**Methodology**

We proposed a suitable wireless security mechanism for the hospital. To begin with, the organizational
characteristics of the hospital should be analyzed before selecting the wireless mechanism. With mobile
devices in HIS, the staff will be able to access EMR systems to view or update patient’s medical records.
The usual methods to provide security at the network level, in the case of packet networks, are
datagram encapsulation. One of the most common technologies used to ensure secure communications
in the Internet is the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol. IPsec is an end-to-end security scheme
operating in the IP stack, enabling both authentication and confidentiality.
